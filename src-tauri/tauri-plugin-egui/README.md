# tauri-plugin-egui

A simple way to render native `egui` UI in a Tauri-managed Window, either alongside or without a Webview.

### Example Usage

```rust
// [1] import the necessary traits
use tauri_plugin_egui::{egui, EguiAppHandleExt, EguiPluginBuilder};

fn main() {
  tauri::Builder::default()
    .setup(|app| {
      // [2] register the plugin as a `wry_plugin`.
      app.wry_plugin(EguiPluginBuilder::new(app.handle().to_owned()));

      // [3] make or get a Tauri `WebviewWindow` / `Window`
      Window::builder(app, "main")
        .inner_size(600.0, 400.0)
        .title("tauri-plugin-egui demo")
        .build()?;

      // [4]
      // start egui for a window with its label
      // pass in a closure that receives the egui::Context
      app.handle().start_egui_for_window(
        "main",
        Box::new(|ctx| {
          egui::CentralPanel::default()
            .show(ctx, |ui| {
              ui.heading("Hello from Egui!");
            });
        }),
      )?;

      Ok(())
    })
    .run(tauri::generate_context!())
    .expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

## Development Guide

This plugin tracks all the windows marked for `egui` in a thread-safe HashMap. Tauri maintains control over the windowing system, `egui` is only used to draw within them. For each "egui-marked" Tauri window, we create an egui context, a GPU surface and graphics renderer (`wgpu`). And tauri's `wry_plugin` mechanism is used to hook into the event loop and drive all the inputs, etc. that `egui` needs, like `RequestRedraw`.

Notes:
1. You can have multiple egui-powered windows in the same Tauri app.
2. We use `wgpu` as graphics backend, but can also consider adding `glow` eventually.
3. Our approach minimizes needing "soft forks", which was a big pitfall of [tauri-egui](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/discussions/10089#discussion-6836749)
4. ~~TEMP: a custom tauri fork is needed atm. Effort is being made to merge these changes upstream.~~ âœ… merged in Tauri v2.7.0

## Goals

I have a Tauri app that needs to render UI without the webview-overhead for some cases. egui seemed like it can work well for this. There was a previous attempt at this by the Tauri team, detailed [here](https://v2.tauri.app/blog/tauri-egui-0-1/) but it has since been de-prioritized due to a large maintainance surface-area. My approach tries to minimize "fork maintainance" as much as possible.

Perhaps we can eventually have this supported as an official Tauri plugin from their plugins workspace, but for now, this is a standalone plugin.
